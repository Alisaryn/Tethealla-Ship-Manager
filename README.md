# Building and Usage
To build, open the .sln file in Visual Studio.
Place ship_manager.exe in the same directory as ship_server.exe and run. Default settings will be loaded if any config files were not found. Minimizing will minimize to the system tray, and closing ship_manager.exe will also close ship_server.exe.
